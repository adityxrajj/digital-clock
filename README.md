# Digital Clock

A simple and responsive digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to create a real-time digital clock that updates every second.

## Features

- Displays the current time in a digital format (HH:MM:SS).

- Responsive design to adjust based on screen size.

- Simple and clean user interface.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage.

- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the clock and overall layout.

- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for updating the time.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adityxrajj/digital-clock.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd digital-clock
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## How It Works

1. The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the page, including a div where the time is displayed.

2. The `style.css` file ensures the clock is styled properly and looks good across different screen sizes.

3. The `script.js` file uses JavaScript to update the time every second and displays it in the specified div (`#digital-clock`).
